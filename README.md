Zork v0.2

The player starts at the entrance. You can move using commands such us: go north, north, n, go south, south, s, etc.
The player can also 'look' to get their current room description again or 'look north' among other directions to get information about the exits around.
There are a total of ten rooms, by now they all have a significative name like "Minoutaur" or "Romaticism". 
All the exits can be closed and two of them are already so the player will have to input 'open door (+ direction)" to keep going.
Input "quit" to leave.
